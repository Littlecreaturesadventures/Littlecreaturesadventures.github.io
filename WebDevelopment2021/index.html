         <p>Mark is a dog with mixiture of Shih Tzu and Yorkie. I'm a kind of person<br>
         that doesn't likes small dogs cause they are not so obidient as big dogs are,
         but<br /> Mark has taught me something different from the other small dog's that<br>
         makes me think that it does not matter the size or race and is the feeling<br>
         that you create with time and the affection being with him.<br />
         It makes me understand that any living being has a beautiful meaning.</p>
